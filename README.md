## Introduction

This web-app is an apartment searching app just like Streeteasy but better. (Think of streeteasy + ratemyprofessor!) We allow users to search for apartments in New York based on different filters such as boroughs or price range and more. However, the most important feature that we provide is for users to check the ratings and reviews of the apartments uploaded by the previous tenants. Users can check those reviews from the previous tenants and save the apartments that fit their conditions and interest.

## Features

- Signup & Login
  - Users can register for a new account and login to use every feature of the service. Users can also continue as guest and still have access to the apartments. Some of the features will be only available to logged in users, however.
- Search for apartments
  - Users can search for apartments specifying the boroughs and price range.
  - User can also search for specific apartments using the address.
